## üì¶ **Working with Docker Images**

### **1. List All Docker Images**
- **`docker images`**: Lists all Docker images that are stored on your system.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker images
    ```
    **Description**: This command shows a list of all the Docker images that have been pulled or created, along with their repository name, tag, image ID, and size.

### **2. Pull a Docker Image**
- **`docker pull <image>`**: Downloads a Docker image from Docker Hub or another Docker registry.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker pull nginx
    ```
    **Description**: This pulls the latest version of the `nginx` image from Docker Hub. The image will be saved locally, allowing you to run containers based on that image.

### **3. Build a Docker Image**
- **`docker build -t <image_name> .`**: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker build -t my_app .
    ```
    **Description**: This creates a new Docker image named `my_app` by reading the instructions in the Dockerfile found in the current directory.

### **4. Remove a Docker Image**
- **`docker rmi <image>`**: Deletes a Docker image from your system.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker rmi nginx
    ```
    **Description**: This command removes a Docker image from your system. It‚Äôs useful for freeing up space or cleaning up unused images.

### **5. Tag a Docker Image**
- **`docker tag <image> <repository:tag>`**: Adds a tag to a Docker image, usually in preparation for uploading to a Docker registry.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker tag my_app myrepo/my_app:v1
    ```
    **Description**: Tagging an image is important when you‚Äôre preparing to push it to a registry. Here, the image `my_app` is tagged as `v1` for uploading to the `myrepo` registry.

### **6. Push a Docker Image to a Registry**
- **`docker push <repository:tag>`**: Uploads a tagged image to a Docker registry like Docker Hub.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker push myrepo/my_app:v1
    ```
    **Description**: This pushes the image `my_app:v1` to the specified registry, making it available for others to download or deploy.

  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker ps
    ```
    **Description**: Shows details about running containers, including container ID, image name, status, and ports.

### **2. List All Containers (Including Stopped)**
- **`docker ps -a`**: Lists all containers, both running and stopped.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker ps -a
    ```
    **Description**: This command shows all containers, whether they are running, stopped, or exited. It‚Äôs useful for troubleshooting and managing containers that are no longer running.

### **3. Run a Container**
- **`docker run <image>`**: Creates and starts a new container from an image.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker run nginx
    ```
    **Description**: This will start an `nginx` container. If the image isn‚Äôt available locally, Docker will pull it from the registry.

### **4. Run a Container in Detached Mode**
- **`docker run -d <image>`**: Starts a container in the background (detached mode).
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker run -d nginx
    ```
    **Description**: Detached mode is useful for running services like web servers. The container will run in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

### **5. Run a Container Interactively with Bash**
- **`docker run -it <image> bash`**: Starts a container and opens an interactive Bash shell inside it.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
    ```
    **Description**: This is ideal for testing or debugging inside a container. It starts a container and gives you a command-line interface to run commands within the container.

### **6. Access a Running Container‚Äôs Shell**
- **`docker exec -it <container_id> bash`**: Accesses the shell of a running container.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker exec -it <container_id> bash
    ```
    **Description**: This allows you to interact with a running container by opening a shell inside it, which is helpful for checking logs or making changes on the fly.

### **7. Stop a Running Container**
- **`docker stop <container_id>`**: Gracefully stops a running container.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker stop <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: This sends a SIGTERM signal to the container, allowing it to stop gracefully before shutting down.

### **8. Start a Stopped Container**
- **`docker start <container_id>`**: Starts a container that was previously stopped.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker start <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: Restarts a container that is in a stopped state without having to create a new one.

### **9. Restart a Container**
- **`docker restart <container_id>`**: Stops and then starts a container, effectively rebooting it.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker restart <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: This is useful for applying changes to a running container or resolving temporary issues without destroying the container.

### **10. Kill a Running Container**
- **`docker kill <container_id>`**: Immediately stops a running container.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker kill <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: This forcefully stops the container by sending a SIGKILL signal, which is faster but doesn‚Äôt allow the container to gracefully shut down.

### **11. Remove a Stopped Container**
- **`docker rm <container_id>`**: Deletes a container that is no longer running.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker rm <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: This removes a stopped container from your system, freeing up resources.

### **12. View Logs from a Container**
- **`docker logs <container_id>`**: Displays the logs of a running or stopped container.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker logs <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: Use this to view the output logs of a container, which is helpful for debugging issues or tracking container activity.

### **13. Inspect a Container**
- **`docker inspect <container_id>`**: Provides detailed information about a container‚Äôs configuration, network, and environment.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker inspect <container_id>
    ```

### **2. Create a New Docker Network**
- **`docker network create <network_name>`**: Creates a new custom Docker network.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker network create my_network
    ```
    **Description**: This creates a custom network that you can use to connect multiple containers for communication.

### **3. Connect a Container to a Network**
- **`docker network connect <network> <container>`**: Attaches a running container to a specified network.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker network connect my_network <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: Use this to connect a container to an existing network, enabling it to communicate with other containers on the same network.

### **4. Disconnect a Container from a Network**
- **`docker network disconnect <network> <container>`**: Detaches a container from a specified network.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    $ docker network disconnect my_network <container_id>
    ```
    **Description**: This disconnects the container from the network, isolating it from other containers.
