## üìÇ **File and Directory Operations**
- **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory path.
  - **Example**: 
    Imagine you're navigating through various folders in a Linux system. If you ever get lost and want to know exactly where you are, use `pwd` to show your current location in the file system.
    ```bash
    $ pwd
    /home/ducanh/Documents/Projects
    ```
    In this case, you're inside the "Projects" folder, which is located under "Documents", in the "home" directory of the user "ducanh".
- **`whoami`**: Display the current logged-in user.
  - **Example**: 
    When you're working on a Linux system with multiple users, you might want to check which user you're currently logged in as. The `whoami` command gives you that information instantly.
    ```bash
    $ whoami
    ducanh
    ```
    In this example, the system responds with "ducanh", indicating that you are logged in as the user "ducanh".
- **`cd`**: Change directory.
  - **Example**: 
    If you want to navigate to a different directory in your file system, use `cd` followed by the path of the directory you want to move to. For instance, if you're currently in your home directory (`/home/ducanh`), and you want to move to the "Documents" folder, you can run:
    ```bash
    $ cd Documents
    ```
    Now, you are inside `/home/ducanh/Documents`. To go back to the parent directory (your home folder), you can simply run:
    ```bash
    $ cd ..
    ```
    This moves you back to `/home/ducanh`.
  - **Tip**: If you're not sure where you are in the directory structure, you can combine `cd` with `pwd` to check your current location after moving:
    ```bash
    $ cd /home/ducanh/Projects
    $ pwd
    /home/ducanh/Projects
    ```
- **`ls`**: List files and directories.
  - **Example**: 
    Suppose you are working in the `/home/ducanh/Documents` directory and wants to see the files and directories available. He can simply type:
    ```bash
    $ ls
    ```
    This will list all the files and directories in that folder.

    To show **hidden files** (files that start with a dot `.`), you can use the `-a` option:
    ```bash
    $ ls -a
    ```
    This command will display hidden files like `.gitignore` in addition to regular files.

    If you wants to list files **sorted by the most recently modified** (newest first), he can use the `-t` option:
    ```bash
    $ ls -t
    ```
    Files and directories will be shown in order of last modification time, with the most recently modified ones at the top.

    For a **detailed list** that shows file permissions, ownership, size, and modification date, you can use the `-l` option:
    ```bash
    $ ls -l
    ```
    This provides a long listing format, showing more detailed information for each file and directory.
- **`mkdir <directory_name>`**: Create a directory.
  - **Example**: 
    You can organizing his projects and wants to create a new directory called "NewProject" in his `Documents` folder. You can use:
    ```bash
    $ mkdir NewProject
    ```
    Now, a directory named `NewProject` is created inside `/home/ducanh/Documents`.

    If you need to create multiple nested directories at once, such as `Projects/Web/Frontend`, you can use the `-p` option to create **parent directories as needed**:
    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p Projects/Web/Frontend
    ```
    This command will create the entire directory structure (`Projects`, `Web`, and `Frontend`) in one go, even if `Projects` and `Web` didn't exist before.

- **`touch <filename>`**: Create an empty file or update file timestamp.
  - **Example**: 
    You are working on a new project and needs to create a blank file called `README.md` in his project folder. You can use the `touch` command to create the file:
    ```bash
    $ touch README.md
    ```
    Now, an empty file named `README.md` is created inside your current directory.

    If You wants to **update the timestamp** of an existing file, such as `index.html`, he can run:
    ```bash
    $ touch index.html
    ```
    This command will not modify the content of the file but will update its last modification time to the current time.

- **`rm <file>`**: Remove a file.
  - **Example**: 
    You have finished working on a temporary file called `temp.txt` and wants to delete it. You can use the `rm` command:
    ```bash
    $ rm temp.txt
    ```
    This command will remove the `temp.txt` file from the current directory.

- **`rm -r <directory>`**: Remove a directory and its contents recursively.
  - **Example**: 
    You realize you no longer needs a directory called `OldProjects` and wants to delete it along with all its contents. You can use:
    ```bash
    $ rm -r OldProjects
    ```
    This command will delete the `OldProjects` directory and all files and subdirectories within it.

- **`rm -rf <directory>`**: Force remove a directory without asking.
  - **Example**: 
    If you are sure you wants to delete a directory named `Archive` without any confirmation prompts, you can use the `-rf` options together:
    ```bash
    $ rm -rf Archive
    ```
    This command will remove the `Archive` directory and everything inside it immediately, without asking for confirmation.

- **`cp <source> <destination>`**: Copy files or directories.
  - **Example**: 
    You want to make a backup of his `project.zip` file. You can use the `cp` command to copy it to a backup folder called `Backup`:
    ```bash
    $ cp project.zip Backup/
    ```
    This command creates a copy of `project.zip` in the `Backup` directory.

- **`cp -r <source_directory> <destination_directory>`**: Copy directories recursively.
  - **Example**: 
    If you want to copy an entire directory called `Images` to the `Backup` directory, you can run:
    ```bash
    $ cp -r Images Backup/
    ```
    This command will copy the `Images` directory along with all its contents into the `Backup` directory.

- **`mv <source> <destination>`**: Move files or directories, or rename them.
  - **Example**: 
    You decides to rename your file `draft.txt` to `final.txt` and move it to the `Documents` directory:
    ```bash
    $ mv draft.txt Documents/final.txt
    ```
    This command renames and moves `draft.txt` to the `Documents` folder as `final.txt`.

- **`cat <filename>`**: Display content of a file.
  - **Example**: 
    If you want to view the contents of your `notes.txt` file, you can use:
    ```bash
    $ cat notes.txt
    ```
    This will display the entire content of `notes.txt` in the terminal.

- **`echo "text" > <filename>`**: Write text to a file (overwriting).
  - **Example**: 
    You want to add a header to his `README.md` file. you can write "Project Title" into the file using:
    ```bash
    $ echo "Project Title" > README.md
    ```
    This command will create (or overwrite) the `README.md` file with the text "Project Title".

- **`tail -n 1 <filename>`**: Display the last line of a file.
  - **Example**: 
    To see the most recent entry in your `log.txt` file, you can run:
    ```bash
    $ tail -n 1 log.txt
    ```
    This will display the last line of `log.txt`.

- **`tail -f <filename>`**: Monitor file for real-time updates.
  - **Example**: 
    You want to watch real-time updates to your `server.log` file as it gets written to. You can use:
    ```bash
    $ tail -f server.log
    ```
    This command will keep the terminal open and display new entries in `server.log` as they are added.

    ```
    If the connection is successful, you will see a blank screen, indicating that you can connect to the server on that port. If the service is not available, it will show an error message.

- **`traceroute <IP>`**: Trace the route packets take to a remote IP.
  - **Example**: 
    To see the path that packets take to reach a specific IP address, you can use the `traceroute` command. For example, to trace the route to `8.8.8.8` (Google's public DNS), you would run:
    ```bash
    $ traceroute 8.8.8.8
    ```
    This command will display each hop along the way, showing the routers that the packets pass through and their response times.

- **`traceroute -T -p 80 <IP>`**: Trace route using TCP on port 80.
  - **Example**: 
    If you want to trace the route to a server using TCP packets instead of the default ICMP, and specifically check the HTTP service on port 80, you can run:
    ```bash
    $ traceroute -T -p 80 example.com
    ```
    This command will trace the route to `example.com` using TCP packets directed at port 80, which is useful for checking web server connectivity specifically.

    ```
    This command adds `john` to the `developers` group, allowing him to have group permissions.

- **`chown -R <user>:<group> <directory>`**: Change ownership of a file or directory.
  - **Example**: 
    To change the ownership of the `project` directory to user `john` and group `developers`, use:
    ```bash
    $ sudo chown -R john:developers project/
    ```
    This command recursively changes the ownership of all files and subdirectories within `project` to `john` and the `developers` group.

- **`chmod u=rx,g=rwx,o=- <directory>`**: Change permissions for a file or directory.
  - **Example**: 
    If you want to set specific permissions on the `project` directory so that the owner has read and execute permissions, the group has read, write, and execute permissions, and others have no permissions, you can run:
    ```bash
    $ sudo chmod u=rx,g=rwx,o=- project/
    ```
    This command sets the permissions as specified, which is crucial for controlling access to files and directories.

- **`grep <pattern> <filename>`**: Search for a pattern inside a file.
  - **Example**: 
    To find all occurrences of the word "error" in the `log.txt` file, you can run:
    ```bash
    $ grep "error" log.txt
    ```
    This command will display all lines in `log.txt` that contain the word "error", making it easy to identify issues in log files.

- **`tar -cvf <archive_name.tar> <directory>`**: Create a tarball from a directory.
  - **Example**: 
    If you want to create an archive named `backup.tar` from the `project` directory, you can execute:
    ```bash
    $ tar -cvf backup.tar project/
    ```
    This command will create a tarball called `backup.tar` containing all the files and subdirectories in the `project` directory.

- **`zip -r <archive_name.zip> <directory>`**: Compress a directory into a zip file.
  - **Example**: 
    To compress the `project` directory into a zip file named `project.zip`, you can run:
    ```bash
    $ zip -r project.zip project/
    ```
    This command will create a zip archive called `project.zip`, which includes all files and folders within the `project` directory, making it easier to share or store.
